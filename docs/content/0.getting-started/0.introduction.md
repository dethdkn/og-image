## Why use Nuxt OG Image?

When you share a link of your site on social media or some chat platforms, the link will be [unfurled](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254),
displaying a title, description, and an image. All of these are powered by the [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/).

New to Open Graph? Check out the [Mastering Open Graph Tags](https://nuxtseo.com/learn/mastering-meta/open-graph) guide to learn more.

Nuxt OG Image allows you to generate these images at runtime or when prerendering, using simple Vue templates.

For example, the OG image for the current page is:

<img src="/__og-image__/static/docs/og-image/getting-started/introduction/og.png" class="rounded-lg">

While it may not help with your organic traffic, it can significantly improve the click-through rate of your pages when shared.

While it's simple to create your own OG images, it can be time-consuming to keep them up-to-date with your site's content and easy to misconfigure
the meta tags for each platform.
